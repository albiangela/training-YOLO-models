Notebooks and functions to train custom YOLO models (bounding boxes, segmentation, keypoints). 

### Resources
 - [General Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mgATEXF9Q3uwyqn36zARJuN-SCao0vWY?usp=sharing) notebook to train a YOLO model (bounding boxes, segmentation, keypoints). In this notebook that are also functions to potentially select only part of the labels to train on, or to rename them.
